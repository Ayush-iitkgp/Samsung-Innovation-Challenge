# Samsung-Innovation-Challenge

This repository contains the code for the project titled "branch@".

We are trying to develop a Chat Application that allows users to branch out and continue particular
sections of their main conversation in separate parallel threads (or branches) which
can be labelled, saved and merged with the main chat thread.

The later part of the project would be to introduced Natural Language Processing feature where the
application would sense changes in the nature (sentiment, context) of conversation
and automatically suggest branching, labeling and other tasks that require manual involvement.
